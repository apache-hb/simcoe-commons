# Simcoe Commons

Inspired by Apache Commons but for C++
This is mostly a collection of what I've written over the years thats ended up being reusable. But bundled into a repo rather than being copy pasted into every project I write.

## Documentation

* Documentation is published to GitHub Pages [here](https://apache-hb.github.io/simcoe-commons/)
